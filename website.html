                    <p><h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
                        Technology plays a transformative role in revolutionizing the design, construction, and operation of buildings and infrastructure. With its advancements, it has become a catalyst for enhancing decision-making and overall performance throughout the entire lifecycle of these structures. One such innovative approach is Building Information Modeling (BIM), which leverages intelligent 3D models to empower architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) professionals. By providing valuable insights and efficient tools, BIM enables them to effectively strategize, design, build, and manage buildings and infrastructure in a more streamlined and effective manner.
